RISD Quickies is a peer-to-peer workshop series I revived with Connor Lynch and Elizabeth Goodspeed. In two years we were able to grow the organization from about 30 yearly participants to over 600, which is roughly 1 in every 4 undergraduate students at RISD. 

We accomplished this with a mix of organizational design, great marketing (all credit goes to Elizabeth for that), and a big social media presence. My main contribution as co-director was operations work including managing the budget, as well as refining our marketing and instructor management strategy.
