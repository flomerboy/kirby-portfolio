Human + Computer is a class I co-facilitated along with David Mellis, Sophia Breuckner, and Tiffany Tseng. The class revolved around the concept of transhumanism. Students conceived and prototyped their own transhumanist technologies that expanded human potential.  The wintersession/IAP class solicited applications from RISD, Brown, and MIT students, and culminated in a group show at Expos√© which was featured on (link: http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/students-combine-art-and-science-while-exploring-transhumanism-slide-show1/ text: Scientific American) and (link: https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/3d5zxk/brown-mit-and-risd-are-implanting-art-into-their-transhumanist-experiments text: The Creator's Project).
