Caption: This kit also included a new "How it Works" section that walks students though the bit-by-bit cause and effect relationships in their inventions. The four open challenges, including "Invent a Chain Reaction Contraption" are completely open to exploration, designed to empower students to put their new inventing skills to use in personally meaningful projects.
