With the littleBits Code Kit, students learn to program by building games with their own custom code.

As a core team member for this project, I lead the execution of all videos, and packaging, and contributed to the design of the inventions, tutorials, the new Bits in the Kit (codeBit and LED Matrix), and the Code Kit App. My main contributions to the design of the Code Kit App were in the design of the software blocks. 

I also storyboarded, produced, and directed two videos for the marketing of the kit.
