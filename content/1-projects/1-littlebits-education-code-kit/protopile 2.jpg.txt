These are some of my 100s of notes on block ideas, user interfaces, and the various tradeoffs associated with design decisions. I can definitely draw these blocks in my sleep now. 

Many thanks go to the teams at Google Blockly and Scratch for their pioneering and enabling work in the design of block-based coding languages.
