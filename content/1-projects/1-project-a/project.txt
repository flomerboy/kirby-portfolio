Text: The littleBits Education Code Kit is a product that encourages budding inventors to design and code their own video games. I was a core team member during the late R&D, product design, and execution phases of the product. That means I contributed to UX Research, defining which Bits are included in the kit what the content (inventions, tutorials, etc.), as well as the packaging and advertising that surrounds the product.
